# Pepper - Complaint Summary

So, our project has been dragging on since the start of this school year, and let's be real—it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. The 5AHIF and the 5CHIF working with the pepper probably have more gray hairs now than when they started. Honestly, it feels like a game of chance whether things will actually work or not. The main gripe? This project is like a mystery novel where the plot keeps changing, and no one knows what's going on. The other teams have been slogging through this mess for way too long, and the lack of proper documentation is driving everyone up the wall. So, here we are, tasked with putting together a complaint summary—basically, airing all our grievances to see if we can hit the reset button on this whole project. Fingers crossed we can pull the plug and start fresh because right now, it's a bit of a hot mess.

### 5CHIF:

1. **Uncertainty about Android Version Compatibility:**
   - Despite investing a year and a half, they still are not sure if it is possible to use a newer Android version (> 8) for Pepper.

2. **Lack of Animation Interruption Knowledge:**
   - The team is grappling with the challenge of understanding how to cancel animations effectively, contributing to a sense of uncertainty.

3. **Slow App Uploads to Pepper:**
   - The process of uploading an app to Pepper is undeniably slow, particularly when relying on WLAN, and there are no faster alternatives or process optimization.

4. **Incomplete Manufacturer Documentation:**
   - The provided documentation lacks completeness, leaving gaps in understanding key aspects such as classes, methods, and overall features from the manufacturer.

5. **Jetpack Compose Reliability on Pepper:**
   - The attempt to use Jetpack Compose on Pepper has been accompanied by persistent errors, requiring attention to address these issues and ensure seamless functionality.

6. **Concerns about Human Awareness and Animation:**
   - The 5CHIF faces challenges where Human Awareness triggered animations seemingly disrupt Pepper's movement.

7. **Opaque Face Recognition Process:**
   - Face recognition is shrouded in mystery, leaving the 5CHIF perplexed about its functioning and the 5CHIF still isn't sure how to save the data about someone.

8. **Parallelization of Tasks:**
   - The CHIF isn't sure how to parallize tasks on the pepper wich would be really important for diverse approaches to tackle computationally intensive tasks efficiently.

9. **General Program Building Ambiguity:**
   - Building programs feels like navigating a maze blindfolded, highlighting the need for comprehensive guidance on structuring and developing programs effectively.

10. **Constraints of QiContext Usage:**
    - The limitations on utilizing QiContext outside the onRobotFocusGained method impose unnecessary restrictions.

### 5AHIF:

### Our Team:

**The struggles our team is facing with this project:**
Our team is currently grappling with several significant challenges in the ongoing project. First and foremost, establishing a connection with the physical Pepper robot has proven to be a complex challenge to say the least. We didn't get it to work yet. Additionally, our attempts at emulation have been met with limited success, adding a layer of complexity to our developmental efforts.

The issue of assistance presents another notable challenge, with our team experiencing a deadlock because the 5AHIF can't help us anymore and the teachers have no idea how to fix our problems either.

Furthermore, the router to connect to pepper has exhibited consistent faults, rendering it as reliable as a chocolate teapot (lol).

Finding tutorials for Pepper development has proven to be a considerable obstacle as well.

So far we have wasted so much time with just trial and error and "useless" reasearch, which is really boring one the one hand and one the other hand we don't really learn anything.

Worst of all, the framework we were tasked to build would be kinda useless. The hardware is from 2005 and every Team who works with the pepper hates it. It takes half a year for every group to see first small results on the pepper, which is underwelming to say the least.

At this point our whole team would appreciate it if we could scrap the pepper side of our project and continue the development of the backend while making the frontend part of the project with a face model on a screen.
