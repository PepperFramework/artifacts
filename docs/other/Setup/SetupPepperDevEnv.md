# Setup Pepper Development Environment (Linux)

## 1. Setup Android Studio

### Download Android Studio
Donwload Android Studio from the Jetbrains-Toolbox and take the standart setup rout (don't configure anything yet, just download the standard stuff. The download may take a while... a long while....)

### Setup SDK
Under Settings -> Langueges and DTDs -> Android SDK -> under SDK Platforms -> choose the latest to install. In our Case: Android API 34.

Now go to Settings -> Langueges and DTDs -> Android SDK -> under SDK Tools -> choose the same version. In our case: Android SDK Build-Tools 34

### Enable Virtualization
Go into your bios settings and check if you have "Virtualization" enabled. If not, enable it.

### Hope that Bonjour is installed on your system
I haven't found out yet how to check if Bounjour is installed or not. I'll write it down if i find it. It should generally be on mac and linux, not on windows tho.

### Get Pepper SDK Plugin
The Pepper plugin isn't available on the marketplace anymore, so we'll have to download it manually.
