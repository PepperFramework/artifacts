=== Faced Obstacles or Challenges which occurred during this Sprint
* Dorn: Massiv Problems with implementations in the frontend
* Nell: X
* Pamminger: Vectordatabase is tricky to setup, had a talk with 5. Grades but still on it, the Vectordatabases are not documented well and most of them only provide a costly cloud based solution.
* Baitura: First Prototype works on the most part, the content of a question is not being recognized tho. (bypassed this for now by using the creation of the assistant as a method of asking a question at the same time)
