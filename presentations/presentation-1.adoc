== Introduction

We want to build a digital receptionist, which is made for (self-check-in) hotels. It should be able to answer all hotel related questions and also do specific tasks like calling a cab or helping with the mobile check-in process. 

=== Layering System

*3 Layers sorted trough AI:*

1. Already known answer

2. Other Source (ChatGPT, Google Maps, etc.)

3. Connection to reception (Chat)

The AI learns from layer 2 and 3.

=== Support

Already made great connections to many interested hotels. Like

* Schwarzer BÃ¤r
* ArtInn
* BeeGreen
* MamaMuh
* Lakeside Village (Czech Republik)
